# Backup Server
Before installing the Veeam Backup & Replication server it is important to
understand the different data streams generated by the Veeam Backup Server (VBR) Service's. Additionally there are considerations in regards to system
requirements that may affect the desired deployment method.

Features & component requirements will affect your decision as to how you install the backup server ie: physical datacenter or different ESXi cluster. It
could also mean that you choose to install additional backup servers or services in remote locations to optimize restore performance.
